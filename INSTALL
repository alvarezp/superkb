To install, you should only need to:
1. "make".
2. As root, "make install".

It should detect everything automagically.

It it doesn't compile, try different values for the entries in the
"configuration" file. Values for "PUTICON_*" can be either "y", "n" or "m", for
"yes", "no", and "module", a la kernel.
