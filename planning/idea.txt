So the idea of the user interface is this:

Super key = Super_[LR] key.

1. superkb loads.
2. User presses (and holds down Super key).
3. A keyboard like the one in "draft.svg" shows up in the screen.
   * That keyboard should make the user aware that W, C and N keys do
     something. Also, that the arrows and editing keys do something too.
4. User might do one of the following:
   a. A user presses (and releases), say, the W. The appropriate action
      (load Writer) should begin. The keyboard should not disappear from
      screen.
   b. A user presses (and holds) any already bound or any bindable key, like
      the W, N or C, or any other alphabet letter, but not Pause, for
      instance. If the user keeps the key held down for 3 seconds, the
      keyboard should disappear and the "Configure Binding" window should
      appear. If the user releases the key before those 3 seconds, it is
      actually point (a).
   c. A user might use the mouse to move or rest the pointer over a key:
      * If he rolls the mouse over a bound key, additional information might
        appear --like making the icon bigger--.
      * If the user clicks a bound key, the action should be performed.
      * If the user holds the mouse button pressed over a key, the key should
        be configured as in point (b).
5. After the user has loaded all the programs he wants, he will release the
   key and the keyboard will disappear. The programs should at this moment
   be loading.
